1) There should be spaces and not tabs
2) YAML is indented  for structure
3) YAML uses dashes for lists
4) YAML uses Colons for key-value pair

Example
=============
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: somewhere  ---- over here we have used 2 spaces instead of tab, and also the key-value pair using colons
  cab: 13 -- again 2 spaces and not tab
roles:
  - web -- having 3 spaces and not tab alsong with dashes to indicate list.
  - dns

5) Character support
    a) YAML support printable Unicode

                - delete
                - next line
