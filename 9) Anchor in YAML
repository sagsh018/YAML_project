1) store and reuse the data
2) Anchor names can be reused
3) Define anchor tag with &
4) reference anchor tag with *
5) Anchor is a single scalar 

Example 1
========

---
host: phl-42
datacenter:
  location: &PHL Philadelphia
---
host: phl-43
datacenter:
  location: *PHL

So no need to write the datacenter location name again

Example 1:
=============

---
roles: &wphost
  - webserver
  - wp_database
--- 
roles: *wphost

So here no need to write the sequence again.
