1) comments in yaml are put using (# ). notice there should be a whitespace after the # symbol
2) we can have comments at the top of yaml file
    example: # This yaml file contain the information about the servers in different data center
3) We can also have inline comment, which should be followed at the end of line
    example: host: phl-43 # This is another server in same data center
4) comments cannot be contained in scalars 
    example " # " - not allowed
5) Comments are for human and no actual content should be conveyed through comment
6) blank lines function as the commented lines 

see the host.yaml file to see how we are using the comments
