1) scalar in python are nothing but the workds we use to represent both keys and there values in a yaml file
    example:
        host: phl-42
        here host is also a string scalar and phl-42 is also a string scalar.
        cab: 13 
        here cab is string scalar and 13 is numeric scalar.
2) In scalars, whitespaces are allowed with using any quotes to enclose them
    example:
        name: Sagar Sharma
        here Sagar sharma, will be counted as valid scalar and will be accepted by yaml and there is no need to
        eclose this in quotes
3) So basically scalars are presented with zero or more unicode characters
4) From above understanding we can also say that mappings are nothing but assigning one scalar value to another scalar value 
5) We can convert non string scalars to string scalars using single or double quotes    
    note that use of double quotes also permists use of escape characters such as \n, \t etc.
6) We can also have multiline scalars in our yaml code, by using two ways:
    a) Block Style (This preserves the newlines)
        example:
        =========
        downtime_sch: |
          2020-11-19 - kernel upgrade
          2020-11-25 - security fix
        here we are using the special character "|". this method is going to preserves the use of newlines and 
        when this yaml code will be processed these multilines are going to be visible and multiple lines only.
    b) Folded style(This converts the newlines/spacing into a single space)
        example:
        ========
        comments: >
          Experiencing high I/O
          since 2020-08-20.
          Current investigating
        So here we are using special character ">". and then this yaml code will be processed it will be represented
        as a single line with single spaces between the words.
7) But suppose if we want to keep the things in different lines using folded style, there is a way to do so by using    
    second indent as below
        example:
        ==========
        comments: >
          Experiencing high I/O
          since 2020-08-20.
          Current investigating
            
            sagar
            sharma
        So if you will notice in the above example, we have kept sagar and sharma after indenting both the names
        and now they will appear in two different lines when this yaml code will be processed.
