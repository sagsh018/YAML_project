1) Sequences or lists in yaml are also called arrays or collections
    a) Note that collection in yaml can be any group of things collectively indented a little for any key.
        that will come under the catagory of collections.
        and thats the reason mappings are also called collections.
2) Sequences/Lists in yaml are denoted with dashes (- )
3) Sequences/Lists in yaml can be combined with mappings in two ways:
    a) mappings of sequences/lists
        example:
        =========
        roles:
          - web
          - dns
        So here we are mapping a key "roles" to the sequence/lists
    b) sequence/list of mappings
        example
        =========
        - locations: somewhare
          cab: 13
          cab_unit: 3
        So here we have a sequence "location" which contains the list of mapping under it.
4) So in our hosts.yaml example file we can add the sequence as below.
    roles:
      - webserver
      - wp_database
    check out the hosts.yaml file to understand
5) The things you cannot do while writing the sequences yaml code:
    a) Sequences cannot be blank
        example:
            - playbooks:
                - wordpress
                -                 ==> This blank is not allowed. if you want to put it blank than use "" to indicate blank.
                - mysql
            and also this is an example of sequences of sequence.
    b) sequences cannot be nested without mapping
        example:
            - playbooks
                - wordpress
                - mysql
            notice that after the main key "playbooks" we haven't kept the colon which will not create it a mapping
            and mappings cannot be missing.

6) we can also mention the sequences in yaml file using the Flow style as well:
    example:
        roles: [ webserver, wp_database ]
