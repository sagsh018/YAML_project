1) structures in yaml are used to structure the yaml file and make it more understandable.
2) Structure in yaml helps in having multiple directives/documents in one single file 
3) These are optional within yaml specification, but may be a requirement for different platform
4) Two types:
    a) Triple dash(---) : To mark the start of a file.
        structure
        =========

        ---
        ---
        ---

        These are also called as Multi-Doc stream, where we can have mulitple document for one stream,
        let say suppose i want to enter the datacenter information for another server in same datacenter location.
        then we can use "---" to mark the start of new doc file in a same stream
        example:
        =========

        ---
        host: phl-43
        datacenter:
          location: someplace2
          cab: "13"
          cab_unit: "4"
        check out the hosts.yaml file to see how this part is used
    b) Triple dots (...) : These are used to mark the end without closing the data stream.
        structure
        ==========

        ---
        ...
        ---

        These are also called as "Stream with end" 
        Suppose i want to enter the server from completely different datacenter location and want to add it after
        ending the current doc without closing the stream
        example
        =========

        ---
        host: phl-43
        datacenter:
          location: someplace2
          cab: "13"
          cab_unit: "4"
        ...
        ---
        host: hel-44
        datacenter:
          location: somewhereelse
          cab: "15"
          cab_unit: "5"
        ...

        check out the host.yaml file to have a look on how these are used inside the yaml file.
5) these triple dashes are used when we create kubernetes configuration file because kubernetes asks to add all the
    docs in one file only.
