1) Mappings are nothing but associated arrays, hash tables, key:value pairs, collection
2) Denoted with colon (:) and space (: )
3) No duplicate key
4) Mappings can be nested

So here we will start writing some of the YAML code. we will try writing the code both in block style and Flow
style

check out the file created : hosts.yaml in the same working space.

Block style
===========
host: phl-42 ----- 1
datacenter: ----- 2
  location: someplace
  cab: 13
  cab_unit: 3

So here:
a) line number 1 in above YAML code is what we call a key value pair.
b) and this is what we call as mapping. means we are mapping the key "host" to value "phl-42"
c) similarly datacenter is another key
d) note that datacenter key and its mapping is called a kind of nested mapping where under key datacenter we have
    another keys and there value mappings.
e) Another thing to note here is that we cannot have suplicate keys in our YAML code.
    for example as we have already used the datacenter key, so we cannot reuse it anywhere below in the code.

Flow style
==============
host: "phl-42"
datacenter: { location: someplace , cab: 13, cab_unit: 3 }

But we will stick to block style YAML for rest of this course.
